This is the sample code to apply technology following points below:
+ Clean architecture (app - business - api) reference the clean architecture book by Uncle Bob. Here is the some introduction about it https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2
+ MVP (Model View Presenter) This structure is easy to read and understand.
+ Dagger 2 (which implemented by google)
+ RxJava 2
+ Retrofit and Okhttp 2

The main purpose of this sample is creating the core structure to adapt different projects. This step is creating it and the next step is applying more new technology and some small projects to see how its adaptation is.
